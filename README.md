# VillaApi
A simple project to apply what I learned in the MongoDB and Unit Test(XUnit Test)
API service that provides authentication and villa management functionalities,The AuthService handles user authentication.
The VillaService manages CRUD operations for villas, while the VillaNumberService handles villa number-related operations.
The project demonstrates the use of MongoDB for data storage and includes unit testing to ensure the functionality of the services.
